This package will generate two files.   GStreamerPlaybin.dll  and  libgstreamer_playbin.so

To use the library simply do the generic steps
      ./configure
      make
      make install  (as root)


This should give you the library GStreamerPlaybin.dll in the path  $prefix/lib/gstreamer-playbin
(where $prefix was defined at ./configure. Usually   /usr/local  )



The package makes use of pkg-config however the library must have the C library  libgstreamer_playbin.so  otherwise it wont work.
libgstreamer_playbin.so can be in the standard library paths or where the executable file is.



sample code:


  using GStreamer;

  public class sample
  {

      public static void Main ()
      {
          Playbin playbin = new Playbin ();
          playbin.Initiate ();
          playbin.Load ("file:///home/user/file.ogg");
          playbin.Play ();

          while (true) {}
      }
  }




Enjoy!
