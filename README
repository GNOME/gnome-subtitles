You can now proceed to "Building from Source" to build Gnome Subtitles.

Note that, regarding the required dependencies, SubLib SVN version may be needed
when building Gnome Subtitles from the SVN. Information on building SubLib from
the SVN is available at: http://sublib.sourceforge.net/development.
