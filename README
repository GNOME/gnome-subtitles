Gnome Subtitles is a subtitle editor for the GNOME desktop. It supports the most
common text-based subtitle formats and allows for subtitle editing, translation
and synchronization.


Dependencies
============

    Mono      	>= 1.1 (mono to run, gmcs to build)
    Gtk+      	>= 2.12
    Gtk-Sharp	>= 2.12
    Glade-Sharp >= 2.12
    GConf-Sharp >= 2.12
    GStreamer 	>= 0.10
    GStreamer-Plugins-Base >= 0.10
    GtkSpell  	>= 2.0
    Enchant   	>= 1.3


Building from Source
====================

Build it with the usual `./configure' followed by `make' commands.
Install it with `make install'.
Run it with `gnome-subtitles' or use the icon in the GNOME menu.

To try the program without installing it, `cd' to the `build' dir after building
it and run it with `mono gnome-subtitles.exe'.

The INSTALL file contains detailed information on this subject.


Building from Git
=================

Get the latest code from the GNOME Git repository:
	git clone git://git.gnome.org/gnome-subtitles

Run `./autogen.sh' to generate the build scripts. Some packages are required:
    autoconf
    automake
    glib-gettext
    gnome-common
    gnome-doc-utils
    gtk-doc
    intltool
    libtool
    pkg-config

You can now proceed to "Building from Source" to build Gnome Subtitles.
See http://live.gnome.org/Git/Developers for more information on how to use the
GNOME Git repository.
