Gnome Subtitles
========================
http://gsubtitles.sf.net

Gnome Subtitles is a subtitle editor for the GNOME desktop. It supports subtitle
editing, conversion and synchronization. It aims to provide a clean and
functional interface to the user, without giving away the needed features.


Dependencies
============

Mono   >= 1.1
Gtk#   >= 2.8
Gnome# >= 2.8
Glade# >= 2.8
Gtk+   >= 2.8

Note: starting with Gnome Subtitles 0.0.2, SubLib is now bundled with the
gnome-subtitles package, so there's no need to build it separately anymore.


Building from Source
====================

Build it using the usual `./configure' command followed by `make'. Install it
with `make install'. Run it with `gnome-subtitles' or just use the icon in the
Gnome Menu.

To try the program without installing it, `cd' to the `build' dir after building
it and run it with `mono gnome-subtitles.exe'.

The INSTALL file contains detailed information on the build procedure.
