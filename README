Building from Source

Install it with `make install'.

To try the program without installing it, `cd' to the `build' dir after building
it and run it with `mono gnome-subtitles.exe'.

The INSTALL file contains detailed information on this subject.


Building from Git
=================

Get the latest code from the GNOME Git repository:
	git clone git://git.gnome.org/gnome-subtitles

Run `./autogen.sh' to generate the build scripts. Some packages are required:
    autoconf
    automake
    glib-gettext
    gnome-common
    gnome-doc-utils
    gtk-doc
    intltool
    libtool

You can now proceed to "Building from Source" to build Gnome Subtitles.
