Gnome Subtitles
=============================
http://gnome-subtitles.sf.net


Easy
====

* Opening an SRT with blank subtitles seems to create subtitles with the number zero as text
* Possibly allow to show the translation text in the video, possibly with a switch.
* Set a more appropriate filename for a new translation, based on the filename of the original file.
* With the cursor inside TranslationEdit, creating a New file doesn't erase the message on the status bar.
* Maybe use two asterisks in the application title (for text and translation)?
* Revise focus/Activation in dialogs
* Changing to an invalid path on file open will try to detect videos in that file and throw exception. Check errors on video file open. When opening a subtitle file in a path without permissions, checking for available video files will throw exception
* Show an error dialog when the user help cannot be displayed
* Add the extension to the filename immediately after opening the SaveAs dialog, not only when changing the format in the dialog
* Increase video playback precision
* Change the SetSubtitleStart and SetSubtitleEnd commands to allow multiple selection
* Improve the Adjust dialog (and perhaps add a new Auto Adjust dialog)
* Add support to copy subtitles from the View to the clipboard (currently only copies text from the editing area)
* Change dialogs in what concerns the selection type (e.g., Ranges)
* Try to use Mime Types instead of patterns in the File Open dialogs
* Choose Open instead of New, by default, in the toolbar
* Set the folder on VideoOpenDialog according to the path of the open video
* Make the use of video extensions more uniform, case insensitive and reusable
* Show a warning when trying to open a large file (probably isn't valid). Perhaps detect if it is plain-text too.
* Configure the gnome-subtitles.in script according to the system (use "sh", possibly without "-a" in BSD)

Hard
====

* Autosave as .bak every # minutes
* Add spell-check support
* Improve status bar messages
* Add support for merging subtitles
* Add support for storing recent files - use RecentFiles from MonoDevelop
* Mark file as changed (show asterisk) when modifying headers
    - Compare each header to the one in Subtitles to see if it has changed
    - GUI.SetWindowTitle
* Save the scrolling state for documents, like Evince does
  Includes storing this somewhere, again
* Star/mark subtitles, like in GMail
* Add localization support
* Add MIME type support


Refactoring
===========

* Move handlers in EventHandlers to the corresponding classes of the user interface

Dependent
=========

* Add GStreamer support (#363412 - depending on GST#)
  Includes refactoring the current mplayer support.
