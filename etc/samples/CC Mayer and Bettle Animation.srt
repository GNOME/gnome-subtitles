00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,610
English subtitles

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,500
You scared me to death!

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,500
What were you doing?

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,000
I was just appreciating this cool song
I just downloaded off the net.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,800
You are so busted

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,900
You’re not allowed to steal music
off the net. It’s illegal.

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,700
I’m going to the cops!

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,300
What is with you? No, it’s ok.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,500
This is a track I got from Opsound

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,000
So who’s Opsound?

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,100
No, Opsound is a website.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,100
You’re allowed to get music that
use Creative Commons licences.

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,900
You only can’t download music
if you don’t have permission.

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,010
Creative Commons means you can.

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,910
Keep talking or I’m going to the cops.

16
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,910
You were an annoying baby, weren’t you?

17
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,510
Keep talking…

18
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,310
Well anything that’s copyrighted ...

19
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,210
you need to get permission to use right? right

20
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,910
But anything licensed under
Creative Commons licences

21
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,410
means you’ve already got permission…

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,010
So you can use it for anything?

23
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,220
Not exactly.

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,820
The licence tells you what you can do.

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,120
If someone makes a song and they decide ...

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,320
Hey this is cool! I’m gonna let other
people use it! They can

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,920
licence the songin a way that says
exactly what others can and can’t do.

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,220
How?

29
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,020
Well, Creative Commons protects
the work in four main ways.

30
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,420
... Which  is just a big word that means

31
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,520
you have to put the author’s name
on anywhere you use their work

32
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:50,030
and ...  which means you can’t
make money off the song

33
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,730
So I can’t sell  it and buy  a car?

34
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,230
No.

35
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,230
and then there’s ... which means ...

36
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,430
you can’t change the song in any way

37
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,130
but there’s also  ... which means

38
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,930
you can change the song how ever you like ...

39
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,830
as long as you licence in the same way

40
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,830
So, if I stick to whatever the artist wants  ...

41
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,830
I can download whatever I want for free?

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,140
Yep.  You can!

43
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,340
So…  if I made the best song in the world ...

44
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,540
and decided that I was ok with
people sharing it just because ...

45
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,740
if people didn’t hear it their lives
wouldn’t be worth living because ...

46
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,540
it was so cool…

47
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,140
Ye-ah, I get the point.

48
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,140
How do they know how it’s licensed?

49
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,740
you have to put a link
next to the mp3 of your song

50
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,640
I think you mean the best song in the world

51
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,740
Stop that!

52
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,550
Say iiit!

53
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,650
You just put a a link next
to the mp3 of

54
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,550
the best song in the world

55
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,050
Alright!

56
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,150
And all people  have to do is
click on the link and it will

57
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,350
take them to a list of what they
can and can’t do with your song.

58
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:08,350
Ok. So where can I download
some of these songs?

59
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,650
They’re all over the web.
But a few good places are…

60
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,750
You got a pen?

61
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,650
Why?

62
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,960
So you can write these sites down.

63
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,160
I don’t need to.

64
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,260
Why not?

65
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,260
Because they’ll appear above
your head as you talk.

66
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,760
Are you serious?!

67
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,160
Give it a try.

68
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:35,260
Creative Commons has an online
music community called CC Mixter.

69
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,460
See.

70
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,660
That’s cool. And Opsound like I said before.

71
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,360
This is so much fun!
Let’s see how many I can get!

72
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,370
Whatever gets you going.

73
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,570
Umm, there’s also Dmusic, SoundClick
and Magnatune ... AND!

74
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,270
In some cases you can do more
with them than just play the songs

75
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:01,370
If the licence says so,
you can sample, mash and remix music.

76
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,370
and you better believe I WILL!!!

77
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,970
Well, I’m going to download some music

78
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:12,570
for free and not illegally. Ah hum.

79
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,270
Uh umm, you can download
other stuff as well.

80
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,270
Really?!

81
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,970
Yeah!
Anything that is created can be licensed.

82
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,180
Stories? Photos? Drawings? Websites?

83
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,580
Yep! All of them!

84
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,080
And movies. And sounds.
And weblogs. And books. And articles.

85
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,080
That’s a lot of stuff. How do I find it?

86
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,980
Creative Commons has its own search
engine: search.creativecommons.org

87
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,580
You’ll find heaps of cool stuff.

88
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,280
That’s really cool. I’ll go check it out.

89
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,480
Ok. Have fun.

90
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,080
Can I report you to the cops anyway?
Just because?

91
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,580
What’s wrong with you is no little thing.

92
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:48,580
