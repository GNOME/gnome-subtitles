1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
    Where the devil should this Romeo be?
    Came he not home to-night?

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,250
Not to his father's;
I spoke with his man.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,000
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,750
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,500
A challenge, on my life.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,250
Romeo will answer it.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Any man that can write may answer a letter.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,750
Nay, he will answer the letter's master,
how he dares, being dared.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead;
stabbed with a white wench's black eye;

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,250
shot through the ear with a love-song;

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,000
the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's
butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,750
Why, what is Tybalt?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,500
More than prince of cats, I can tell you.
O, he is the courageous captain of compliments.

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,250
He fights as you sing prick-song,
keeps time, distance, and proportion;

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,000
rests me his minim rest, one, two, and the third...

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,750
...in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button,
a duellist, a duellist;

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,500
a gentleman of the very first house,
of the first and second cause...

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,250
 ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the hai!

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,000
The what?
