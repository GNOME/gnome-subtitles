Gnome Subtitles
========================
http://gsubtitles.sf.net


Easy
====

* Grab UnknownCharEncodingException in the Open dialog to display a proper error message
* Mark file as changed (show asterisk) when modifying headers
* Hide the file's extension when saving a file (it's appended automatically)
* Refactor: store a reference to GUI in the CommandManager, for it to pass to the Undo/Redo/other methods,
  instead of passing the GUI to each Command created
* Refactor: put each glade dialog in a separate file
* Move widget names in WidgetNames to each dialog class
* Refactor: GladeWidget class
* Add support to copy subtitles from the subtitle list to the clipboard (currently only copies text from
  the subtitle editing area

Hard
====

* Add Find/Replace dialog(s)
* Add support for subtitle translation
* Add spell-check support
* Add support for choosing the character encodings to be used in the open and save dialogs
  Includes adding a gconf access layer (to store used encodings) and a dialog for choosing encodings
* Show recent files in Open menu
  Includes storing these files somewhere (gconf or in the filesystem?)
* Save the scrolling state for documents (and perhaps other things, like the window size), like Evince does
  Includes storing these somewhere, again
* Star/mark subtitles, like in GMail
* Add builtin movie previewing (#363412 - depending on GST#)
  Includes adding a movie previewer layer so multiple previewers can be used
  Try support for GST but also mplayer and xinelib, for instance
* Add localization support
* Create help documentation
* Add MIME type support
