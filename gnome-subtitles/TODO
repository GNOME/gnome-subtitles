Gnome Subtitles
=============================
http://gnome-subtitles.sf.net


Easy
====

* Changing the TimingMode doesn't update spin buttons (after saving a new subtitle)
* Add support to copy subtitles from the View to the clipboard (currently only copies text from the subtitle editing area
* Improve autogen.sh and configure.in (require automake 1.9)
* Autoselect "Apply to selection" if there are subtitles selected when shift/etc dialogs are shown
* Check the bug report window. It should also point to the forums, in case no registration is intended.
* ChangeTextCommand should store the position of the cursor
* Change dialogs in what concerns the selection type (e.g., Ranges)
* Change dialogs to be centered on the parent window
* Try to use Mime Types instead of patterns in the File Open dialogs
* Choose Open instead of New, by default, in the toolbar
* Think about using Bug-Buddy
* Store the current video folder so use in the VideoOpenDialog

Hard
====

* Add support for subtitle translation
* Add spell-check support
* Add status bar messages
* Add support for merging subtitles
* Add support for storing recent files - use RecentFiles from MonoDevelop
* Mark file as changed (show asterisk) when modifying headers
    - Compare each header to the one in Subtitles to see if it has changed
    - GUI.SetWindowTitle
* Add support for choosing the character encodings to be used in the open and save dialogs
  Includes adding a gconf access layer (to store used encodings) and a dialog for choosing encodings
* Save the scrolling state for documents (and perhaps other things, like the window size), like Evince does
  Includes storing these somewhere, again
* Star/mark subtitles, like in GMail
* Add localization support
* Create help documentation
* Add MIME type support


Refactoring
===========

* Move handlers in EventHandlers to the corresponding classes of the user interface
* Put [WidgetAttribute] on the same line as widget declarations
* Think about using Actions

Dependent
=========

* Add GStreamer support (#363412 - depending on GST#)
  Includes refactoring the current mplayer support.
