Gnome Subtitles
=============================
http://gnome-subtitles.sf.net


Easy
====

* Add current video information to the Shift dialog.
* Improve the Adjust dialog (or perhaps add a new Auto Adjust dialog)
* Remove the NAnt file (and update website with this info)
* Add support to copy subtitles from the View to the clipboard (currently only copies text from the editing area)
* Improve autogen.sh and configure.in (require automake 1.9)
* Autoselect "Apply to selection" if there are subtitles selected when shift/etc dialogs are shown
* Check the bug report window. It should also point to the forums, in case no registration is intended.
* ChangeTextCommand should store the position of the cursor
* Change dialogs in what concerns the selection type (e.g., Ranges)
* Change dialogs to be centered on the parent window
  * Include changing the .glade file Visible to False and using ShowDialog in the constructor
* Try to use Mime Types instead of patterns in the File Open dialogs
* Choose Open instead of New, by default, in the toolbar
* Set the folder on VideoOpenDialog according to the path of the open video
* Make the use of video extensions more uniform, case insensitive and reusable
* Show a warning when trying to open a large file (probably isn't valid). Perhaps detect if it is plain-text too.
* Add a message to the end of the Gentoo ebuild to inform the users to install MPlayer.
* Configure the gnome-subtitles.in script according to the system (use "sh", possibly without "-a" in BSD)

Hard
====

* Add support for subtitle translation
* Add spell-check support
* Add status bar messages
* Add support for merging subtitles
* Add support for storing recent files - use RecentFiles from MonoDevelop
* Mark file as changed (show asterisk) when modifying headers
    - Compare each header to the one in Subtitles to see if it has changed
    - GUI.SetWindowTitle
* Save the scrolling state for documents, like Evince does
  Includes storing these somewhere, again
* Star/mark subtitles, like in GMail
* Add localization support
* Create help documentation
* Add MIME type support


Refactoring
===========

* Move handlers in EventHandlers to the corresponding classes of the user interface
* Think about using Actions

Dependent
=========

* Add GStreamer support (#363412 - depending on GST#)
  Includes refactoring the current mplayer support.

Fixed
=====
* Put [WidgetAttribute] on the same line as widget declarations
* Auto Select the Encoding being used when using SaveAs
* Automatically open the video file when running Gnome Subtitles with a subtitle file as argument
* Added Manpage
* Changing the TimingMode doesn't update spin buttons (after saving a new subtitle)
* Don't show any error when opening a blank file
* Use BugBuddy, reverting to the old bug reporter when BugBuddy cannot be found.

Bugs:
417310 - Error shown when opening a blank file
417303 - Can't load srt subtitles - detected encoding is not supported
417869 - MPlayer fails for each second file
