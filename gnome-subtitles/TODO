Gnome Subtitles
=============================
http://gnome-subtitles.sf.net


Easy
====

* Add Ln and Col information to the status bar
	- Have 3 status bars, like in gedit
* Increase video playback precision
* Change the SetSubtitleStart and SetSubtitleEnd commands to allow multiple selection
* Improve the Adjust dialog (and perhaps add a new Auto Adjust dialog)
* Add support to copy subtitles from the View to the clipboard (currently only copies text from the editing area)
* ChangeTextCommand should store the position of the cursor
* Change dialogs in what concerns the selection type (e.g., Ranges)
* Try to use Mime Types instead of patterns in the File Open dialogs
* Choose Open instead of New, by default, in the toolbar
* Set the folder on VideoOpenDialog according to the path of the open video
* Make the use of video extensions more uniform, case insensitive and reusable
* Show a warning when trying to open a large file (probably isn't valid). Perhaps detect if it is plain-text too.
* Add a message to the end of the Gentoo ebuild to inform the users to install MPlayer.
* Configure the gnome-subtitles.in script according to the system (use "sh", possibly without "-a" in BSD)

Hard
====

* Autosave as .bak every # minutes
* Add support for subtitle translation
* Add spell-check support
* Add status bar messages
* Add support for merging subtitles
* Add support for storing recent files - use RecentFiles from MonoDevelop
* Mark file as changed (show asterisk) when modifying headers
    - Compare each header to the one in Subtitles to see if it has changed
    - GUI.SetWindowTitle
* Save the scrolling state for documents, like Evince does
  Includes storing these somewhere, again
* Star/mark subtitles, like in GMail
* Add localization support
* Create help documentation
* Add MIME type support


Refactoring
===========

* Move handlers in EventHandlers to the corresponding classes of the user interface
* Think about using Actions

Dependent
=========

* Add GStreamer support (#363412 - depending on GST#)
  Includes refactoring the current mplayer support.
