Gnome Subtitles
========================
http://gsubtitles.sf.net


Easy
====

* Hide the file's extension when saving a file (it's appended automatically)
* Refactor: store a reference to GUI in the CommandManager, for it to pass to the Undo/Redo/other methods, instead of passing the GUI to each Command created
* Refactor: put each glade dialog in a separate file
* Move widget names in WidgetNames to each dialog class
* Refactor: GladeWidget class
* Add support to copy subtitles from the subtitle list to the clipboard (currently only copies text from the subtitle editing area


Hard
====

* Add Find/Replace dialog(s)
* Add support for subtitle translation
* Add spell-check support
* Mark file as changed (show asterisk) when modifying headers
    - Compare each header to the one in Subtitles to see if it has changed
    - GUI.SetWindowTitle
* Add support for choosing the character encodings to be used in the open and save dialogs
  Includes adding a gconf access layer (to store used encodings) and a dialog for choosing encodings
* Save the scrolling state for documents (and perhaps other things, like the window size), like Evince does
  Includes storing these somewhere, again
* Star/mark subtitles, like in GMail
* Add localization support
* Create help documentation
* Add MIME type support


Dependent
=========

* Show recent files in Open menu (depending on support for GtkRecent in GTK#)
* Add builtin movie previewing (#363412 - depending on GST#)
  Includes adding a movie previewer layer so multiple previewers can be used
  Try support for GST but also mplayer and xinelib, for instance
