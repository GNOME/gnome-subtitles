Gnome Subtitles
=============================
http://gnome-subtitles.sf.net


Easy
====

* Changing the TimingMode doesn't update spin buttons (after saving a new subtitle)
* Add support to copy subtitles from the View to the clipboard (currently only copies text from the subtitle editing area
* Improve autogen.sh and configure.in (require automake 1.9)
* Add Ctrl+Z for Undo (and the respective for Redo)
* Autoselect "Apply to selection" if there are subtitles selected when shift/etc dialogs are shown
* Check the bug report window. It should also point to the forums, in case no registration is intended.
* ChangeTextCommand should store the position of the cursor
* Change dialogs in what concerns the selection type (e.g., Ranges)

Hard
====

* Add support for subtitle translation
* Add spell-check support
* Add status bar
* Add support for merging subtitles
* Add support for storing recent files - use RecentFiles from MonoDevelop
* Mark file as changed (show asterisk) when modifying headers
    - Compare each header to the one in Subtitles to see if it has changed
    - GUI.SetWindowTitle
* Add support for choosing the character encodings to be used in the open and save dialogs
  Includes adding a gconf access layer (to store used encodings) and a dialog for choosing encodings
* Save the scrolling state for documents (and perhaps other things, like the window size), like Evince does
  Includes storing these somewhere, again
* Star/mark subtitles, like in GMail
* Add localization support
* Create help documentation
* Add MIME type support


Refactoring
===========

* Put each glade dialog in a separate file
* Get rid of WidgetNames - use separate functions and WidgetAttribute to autoconnect handlers
* Move widget names in WidgetNames to the corresponding classes of the user interface
* Move handlers in EventHandlers to the corresponding classes of the user interface
* Review widget names in glade
* Change "fileName" occurrences to "filename"
* Change to "Movie" occurences to "Video"
* Use Util.PathIndex in all places where path indexes are used
* Update the way timing mode change is propagated (UpdateFromTimingMode)
* Change the way frame rates are changed and set (including in their commands)
* Put [WidgetAttribute] on the same line as widget declarations
* Start using Actions

Dependent
=========

* Add builtin movie previewing (#363412 - depending on GST#)
  Includes adding a movie previewer layer so multiple previewers can be used
  Try support for GST but also mplayer and xinelib, for instance
