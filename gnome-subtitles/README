Gnome Subtitles
=============================
http://gnome-subtitles.sf.net

Gnome Subtitles is a subtitle editor for the GNOME desktop. It supports the most
common text-based subtitle formats and allows for subtitle editing, conversion
and synchronization.


Dependencies
============

Required:
    Mono   >= 1.1 (mono to run, gmcs to build)
    Gtk+   >= 2.8
    Gtk#   >= 2.8
    Gnome# >= 2.8
    Glade# >= 2.8
	GConf# >= 2.8

Optional:
    MPlayer >= 1.0 (runtime dependency, enables video previewing)


Building from Source
====================

Build it with the usual `./configure' followed by `make' commands.
Install it with `make install'.
Run it with `gnome-subtitles' or use the icon in the GNOME menu.

To try the program without installing it, `cd' to the `build' dir after building
it and run it with `mono gnome-subtitles.exe'.

The INSTALL file contains detailed information on this subject.


Building from SVN
=================

Checkout the latest code from the GNOME SVN:
	svn co http://svn.gnome.org/svn/gnome-subtitles/trunk/gnome-subtitles

Next, `cd' to the project dir and checkout the latest SubLib code from the
Sourceforge.net SVN:
	svn co https://sublib.svn.sf.net/svnroot/sublib/trunk/sublib

Finally, run `autogen.sh' to generate the build scripts (note - you'll need to
have "gnome-common" installed).

You can now proceed to "Building from Source" to build Gnome Subtitles.
