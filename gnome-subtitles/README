Gnome Subtitles
========================
http://gsubtitles.sf.net

Gnome Subtitles is a subtitle editor for the GNOME desktop. It supports subtitle editing,
conversion and synchronization. It aims to provide a clean and functional interface to
the user, without giving away the needed features.


Dependencies
============

Mono   >= 1.0
Gtk#   >= 2.8
Gnome# >= 2.8
Glade# >= 2.8
Gtk+   >= 2.8
SubLib >= 0.1 (used while compiling, not to be installed - see below)


Building from Source
====================

First of all, there must be a compiled `sublib.dll' in the build dir (which must be created
if it doesn't exist). You can get SubLib at http://sublib.sourceforge.net. It is available in
two flavors: as a pre-compiled dll and as a source package. If you want to use the dll, simply
copy it to Gnome Subtitle's `build' dir. If you want to build it using the source package,
unarchive it and run the usual `./configure' followed by `make'. Then copy `sublib.dll' from
SubLib's `build' dir to Gnome Subtitle's `build' dir.

To build Gnome Subtitles (after `sublib.dll' is in the `build' dir), run once again the usual
commands: `./configure' followed by `make'. To install it, run `make install'. To run the program
without installing it, simply `cd' to the `build' dir and run `mono gnome-subtitles.exe'. See the
INSTALL file for more information on the build procedure.

To run Gnome Subtitles, simply use the icon in the Gnome menu or run `gnome-subtitles'.
